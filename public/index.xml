      <description>When I first joined Indorelawan as a fresh-faced graduate, I had my fair share of battles with MongoDB replication. We had two servers: one for the primary and one for the secondary. Simple, right? Well, not so much. Every time the secondary server decided to take a nap, the primary would throw in the towel too. It was a complete disaster, and Iâ€™ll admit&amp;ndash;I got so frustrated that I just ripped the replication feature out entirely (not my proudest moment, but hey, desperate times).</description>

      <description>Alright, let&amp;rsquo;s face it: as much as we love PostgreSQL, it can sometimes feel like finding the source of your database&amp;rsquo;s performance issues is like finding a needle in a haystack. But what if I told you there&amp;rsquo;s an extension in your PostgreSQL toolbox that can help you identify and fix these pain points? Enter pg_stat_statements.&#xA;What is pg_stat_statements?

      <title>Automating Reviewer Assignments for NEO Sense and Monika</title>

      <description>In Hyperjump, we handle two main projects: NEO Sense and Monika. Each day, we get assigned to review pull requests for these projects. To ensure fairness and randomness, at the start of every month, our team lead randomize the assignments, making sure each project has two reviewers, and no one is assigned to both projects on the same day. Our team lead used to manage this process manually in Excel, which was a pain the ass I&amp;rsquo;m sure.</description>
